# Password Generator Starter Code
This is a random password generator that should:

Prompt the user to input a password length

Ask user if they'd like lowercase, uppercase, numerical, and/or symbols in their password

Generate the password or provide an error message. 

Aili's notes: 
- Develop branch was main trial and error branch, realized I had to move the variables inside my function, so created the testbranch to try my theory without messing up the develop branch. Left develop branch as is for future investigations/learnings. 

- Was able to merge testbranch to main and main to origin git. 

- Input is working correctly, prompts are working correctly, but unable to make the password length actually force the length the user input. I believe it's something in the "for" function with i, and maybe setting i to the password length, but that didn't run the loop... tried adding mimimum length of the password length to the math.floor functions and it created undefined errors for my variables.
